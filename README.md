These are some 3D walls, for modular house construction.

The base model is 2.4m tall (standard height) by 1m wide and 10cm thick (also standard height).

Model origin is the center-bottom; this is the unity standard but would obviously work in other
cases too.

UV mapping is a repeated pattern, where the source image should represent a 1m by 1m area. Mapping
starts at the bottom of the wall.

There are a number of variations available, to meet various needs

Various additional versions are available.


Variations
----------

Corners

There are versions with the front face missing 10cm on the left, right, and both sides.
This can be used to create sharp corners by putting two next to each other at a right angle.


NoEdgeSame

These walls don't have edges.
The front and back face are the same object.


NoEdgeSplit

These walls don't have edges.
The front and back face have been split to separate objects, to easily allow for separate materials.
